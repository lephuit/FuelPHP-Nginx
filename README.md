This is my test Nginx config to use with FuelPHP Framework that I am learning right now. Being not so good fan of Apache, everything .htaccess can do, Nginx does it better, this config proves it.

Since I have hell lots of vhosts in my system, I decided to give port 57 to this vhost config, feel free to change according to your need. 

This config is well tested for FuelPHP 1.5. If you are using FuelPHP for your production better consult system admin before using this config, alternatively I am ready to help when I am free: if you need some professional config for development, but don't count on my words. It may take time.

Good luck !!!
