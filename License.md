1. I read somewhere in the Licence text of FuelPHP, it was written "Don't be a dick" Licence. So, here I repeat about the license about this config "Don't be a fucking stupid dick - use condom - happy dicks last longer"

2. This Configuration doesn't Guarantee that it will work in your setup. If contacted for some help for configuration then I may probably help during my free time.

3. This Configuration only targeted for Web Application Development using FuelPHP Framework.

4. You are free to use this and distribute
